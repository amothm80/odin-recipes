    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining 
    access to the webpage from which it was opened. The noreferrer
    value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage
    or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. It also 
    includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by 
    itself as well. Note that you may be fine if you forget 
    to add rel="noopener noreferrer" since more recent 
    versions of browsers provide security if only 
    target="_blank" is present. Nevertheless, in line with 
    good coding practices and to err on the side of caution, 
    it is recommended to always pair a target="_blank" with 
    a rel="noopener noreferrer". -->
